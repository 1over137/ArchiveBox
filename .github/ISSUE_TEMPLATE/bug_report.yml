      label: Describe the bug
      description: |
        A description of what the issue is, what you expected to happen, and if relevant, the URLs you were trying to archive.  
        Please note it is normal to see errors occasionally for some extractors on some URLs (not every extractor will work on every page, that's why ArchiveBox provides many extractors).  
        Please only report archiving errors if you are seeing them consistently across many URLs or if they are entirely preventing you from using ArchiveBox.
      placeholder: "Got a bunch of 'singlefile was unable to archive this page' errors when trying to archive URLs from this site: https://example.com/xyz ..."
